Object-Oriented Programming:

A command-line application that accepts user input. 
I am prompted for my team members and their information then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
When I click on an email address in the HTML, my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. 
When I click on the GitHub username that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
When I start the application, I am then prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team. 
When I decide to finish building my team I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
